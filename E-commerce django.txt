To build an e-commerce website using Django, you will need the following requirements:

1. Python: Django is a Python web framework, so ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Django: Install Django using pip, the Python package manager. You can run the command `pip install Django` to install it.

3. Database: Determine the database management system you want to use, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. Install the corresponding database server and required Python packages like `psycopg2` or `mysqlclient` to connect Django with the database.

4. Virtual Environment: Set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. You can use the `venv` module included with Python, or tools like `virtualenv`.

5. Text Editor or IDE: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your Django code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or Atom.

6. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Familiarize yourself with HTML for page structure, CSS for styling, and basics of JavaScript for client-side interactivity.

7. Django Packages: Django offers various packages for e-commerce functionality. Some commonly used Django packages for e-commerce are `django-oscar`, `django-shop`, and `django-catalogue`. Research and choose the package that best aligns with your requirements.

8. Payment Gateway: Select a payment gateway or integration like Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree to handle online transactions. Each payment gateway has its own integration process and documentation.

9. Hosting: Determine where you will host your website. You can use cloud platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, or traditional web hosting providers. Make sure the hosting platform supports Python and Django applications.

10. SSL/TLS Certificate: If you plan to handle sensitive information like user credentials or payment details, obtain an SSL/TLS certificate to ensure secure communication between the user's browser and your website.

Remember to refer to the Django documentation and relevant package documentation for detailed instructions on building an e-commerce website using Django.
