2. Web Hosting: Find a reliable web hosting service provider that can host your website on their servers. Ensure they offer sufficient storage and bandwidth for your expected traffic.

3. SSL Certificate: Implement Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on your website to ensure secure online transactions and protect customer data.

4. Design and User Interface: Create an appealing and user-friendly website design that aligns with your brand image. It should be easy to navigate, responsive across devices, and have clear call-to-action buttons.

5. Product Management System: Utilize a robust product management system to efficiently add, modify, and delete products, manage inventory, set prices, and handle product images and descriptions.

6. Shopping Cart and Payment Gateway: Implement a shopping cart system that allows customers to add products, calculate totals, and proceed to checkout. Integrate a reliable and secure payment gateway to process online transactions.

7. Order and Customer Management: Set up a system to manage orders, track shipments, provide order status updates, handle returns, and manage customer details and inquiries.

8. Security and Privacy: Implement necessary security measures to protect customer data, including secure login systems, encrypted payment processing, and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.

9. SEO and Analytics: Optimize your website for search engines (SEO) to improve visibility and attract organic traffic. Integrate analytics tools to track website performance, user behavior, and conversion rates.

10. Mobile Optimization: Ensure your e-commerce website is optimized for mobile devices, as a significant portion of online traffic comes from mobile users.

Remember, these requirements may vary depending on the complexity and scale of your e-commerce website. It's always recommended to consult with web developers and designers to ensure a successful e-commerce website launch.

Below is an example code for a Django web application that serves as a mediator between parents (family) and freelancers. It includes a question bank for parents to assess their needs, a profit calculation for the company during the payment process, and a login system with an admin interface:



# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)

class Freelancer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    # Add more fields as per your requirements

class Parent(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Add more fields as per your requirements

class Payment(models.Model):
    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    freelancer = models.ForeignKey(Freelancer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    amount = models.FloatField()
    # Add more fields as per your requirements

# myapp/forms.py
from django import forms
from myapp.models import Parent

class QuestionForm(forms.Form):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        question_list = kwargs.pop('question_list')
        super(QuestionForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        for question in question_list:
            self.fields[question.question_text] = forms.ChoiceField(label=question.question_text,
                                                                    choices=[('yes', 'Yes'), ('no', 'No')])

class ParentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Parent
        fields = ['username', 'password', 'email', '...']  # Add more fields as per user registration form requirements

# myapp/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test
from myapp.models import Question, Freelancer, Parent, Payment
from myapp.forms import QuestionForm, ParentForm

@login_required
def question_bank(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = QuestionForm(request.POST, question_list=Question.objects.all())
        if form.is_valid():
            # Process parents' answers
            return redirect('freelancers')
    else:
        form = QuestionForm(question_list=Question.objects.all())

    return render(request, 'question_bank.html', {'form': form})

@login_required
def freelancers(request):
    freelancers = Freelancer.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'freelancers.html', {'freelancers': freelancers})

@login_required
def select_freelancer(request, freelancer_id):
    parent = Parent.objects.get(user=request.user)
    freelancer = Freelancer.objects.get(id=freelancer_id)
    amount = 100  # Amount calculation based on parent's requirements
    profit = amount * 0.1  # 10% profit for the company
    Payment.objects.create(parent=parent, freelancer=freelancer, amount=amount)
    return redirect('payments')

@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.userprofile.is_admin)
def payments(request):
    payments = Payment.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'payments.html', {'payments': payments})

# myapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import question_bank, freelancers, select_freelancer, payments
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='login.html'), name='login'),
    path('question-bank/', question_bank, name='question_bank'),
    path('freelancers/', freelancers, name='freelancers'),
    path('freelancers/<int:freelancer_id>/', select_freelancer, name='select_freelancer'),
    path('payments/', payments, name='payments'),
]
